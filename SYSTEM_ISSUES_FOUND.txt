CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND
==============================================================================

1. HOME PAGE - RECENT HIGHLIGHTS NAVIGATION BUG
   Location: src/pages/Home.tsx, Line 257
   Severity: HIGH
   Description: Clicking on "Recent Highlights" event cards does not navigate 
                to the event detail page. The Link component has target="_blank"
                which may be interfering with navigation.
   Impact: Users cannot access event details from the home page.
   
2. HOME PAGE - RAW HTML IN EVENT DESCRIPTIONS
   Location: src/pages/Home.tsx, Line 268
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Description: Event descriptions are displaying raw HTML tags (e.g., <p>, 
                style attributes) instead of rendered text.
   Impact: Poor user experience with unformatted text visible.
